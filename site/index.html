<h1>Our mission</h1>

<p>To promote Linux as much as possible by setting up booths in town and city centers, giving out discs and showing people live Linux systems. We hope to have 55% of home desktop users use Linux.</p>

<h2>What is Linux?</h2>

<p>Linux is an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system">operating system</a> for computers, just like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows">Windows</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS_X">Mac OS X</a>.

<h2>Why use Linux when I've got Windows?</h2>

<ul class="linuxAdvantages">
    <li><strong>Linux is free of charge.</strong> That's right &mdash; you get a full operating system complete with applications, all for free!</li>

    <li><strong>Linux gives you freedom.</strong> Linux and most of its applications are <a href="https://gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free software</a>. You can absolutely legally study how they work, modify and improve them, fix errors, share them with others for free and even sell them. Even if you can't program, you can ask or pay any programmer to do the changes you want for you.</li>

    <li><strong>Linux will never betray you.</strong> Linux will never present you with nasty surprises like forced updates, removing programs and data without your contest or spying on you. <a href="@page_root@proprietary-software-betrays.html">Read how proprietary software betrays its users.</a></li>

    <li><strong>Linux is secure.</strong> Linux is developed with security in mind. Most of the websites, such as Google, Twitter and Facebook, are served to you by Linux. Many militaries use Linux on their servers.</li>

    <li><strong>Linux is highly customizable.</strong> You're not forced to use a graphical user interface you're not comfortable with. There a lot of varieties of user interfaces in Linux, from shiny and hardware-demanding (<a href="@page_root@desktop/kde.html">KDE</a>, <a href="http://www.gnome.org/gnome-3/">GNOME</a>, <a href="http://www.enlightenment.org/p.php?p=about/e17">Enlightenment</a>) to simplistic and lightweight (<a href="http://lxde.org/">LXDE</a>, <a href="http://www.xfce.org/">XFCE</a>) and unconventional (<a href="http://i3wm.org/">i3</a>).</li>

    <li><strong>Linux is lightweight.</strong> Linux is a lot lighter on hardware resources than Windows, enough to revive a very ancient computer but provide as much functionality as Windows does. Most of the non-essential but hardware demanding features such as desktop effects can be toned down or turned off.</li>

    <li><strong>Linux comes in lots of flavors.</strong> The word "Linux" actually refers to a family of operating systems based on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel">Linux kernel</a>, rather than to a single operating system. This is a natural consequence of Linux being <a href="https://gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free software</a>: people are not prohibited from making their own Linux based operating systems and they do so. There are many different varieties of Linux, each with own strengths and weaknesses.</li>

    <li><strong>Linux has powerful developer tools.</strong> You can write Linux application in pretty much any programming language: C, C++, Objective-C, C#, VisualBasic.NET, Java, FreePascal (TurboPascal and Delphi compatiable), JavaScript, Perl, Ruby, Python are all included. Linux includes powerful integrated development environments, such as Eclipse, Code::Blocks, CodeLite, MonoDevelop. There are no limited "educational" versions of these tools, they allow you to harness the full power of your computer for free!</li>
</ul>

<h2>Convinced already?</h2>

<p>Linux can run on pretty much any computer that isn't <a href="@page_root@linux-is-in-danger.html">locked out of it by manufacturer</a>.</p>

<p>You can boot full Linux desktop from a CD or a pendrive without making any changes to your computer. If you like it, you can install it permanently, either alongside your existing operating system or instead of it.</p>
