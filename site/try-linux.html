<h1>Try Linux!</h1>

There are many flavors of Linux out there, each with own strengths and weaknesses. Pick one that you like!

<h2>Recommended by Linux Promotion</h2>

<p>We recommend a distribution called <a href="http://fedoraproject.org">Fedora</a>. We consider it a good choice for beginners.  It has many features that we enjoy:</p>

<ul class="distroPoints">
    <li class="pro">Easy to use.</li>
    <li class="pro">Ships modern, up-to-date software.</li>
    <li class="pro">New versions are released every 6 months.</li>
    <li class="pro">Cares about freedom, doesn't ship any proprietary software except absolutely essential drivers.</li>
    <li class="pro">Doesn't modify the software it ships.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Other distributions</h2>

<p>If you don't like our recommended distribution you can pick any of the other easy to use distributions and try it instead. Here's a list of the most common distributions. Note that we can't cover all the Linux distributions here: there are literally hundreds of them. Visit <a href="http://distrowatch.com/">DistroWatch</a> for even more distributions.</p>

<p><em>This list is still very incomplete!</em></p>
