<h1>Linux is in danger!</h1>

<p>Secure Boot is a new security technology that can revolutionize computer security. However, we're afraid that it will be used the wrong way.</p>
Secure Boot works by allowing the computer only to boot operating systems that are signed by a certain person or a company. If users are allowed to install signatures of their own, Secure Boot can make Linux even more secure than it is now, as viruses, even if they manage to get through already strong Linux security, won't be able to change any system files.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, using its market dominance, Microsoft can force hardware manufacturers to disallow users to install their own signatures and only include Microsoft's signature. Microsoft already did that for devices with ARM based processors (which usually are tablets and netbooks). One must pay a fee to make it possible to sign a custom operating system on these devices.</p>

<p>However, Microsoft doesn't sign third-party operating systems for some computers, like Microsoft Surface, even for a fee. That's right, it's impossible to install anything but Windows on Microsoft Surface.</p>

<p>We are afraid that there will be more and more such computers and many people will be essentially locked out from Linux.</p>
